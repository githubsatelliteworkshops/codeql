> CodeQL is GitHub's expressive language and engine for code analysis, which allows you to explore source code to find bugs and security vulnerabilities. During these beginner-friendly workshops, you will learn to write queries in CodeQL and find known security vulnerabilities in open-source Java and JavaScript projects.

> There are two workshops on this topic. Both will cover the basics of writing queries in CodeQL. The first will focus on Java, and the second will focus on JavaScript.
